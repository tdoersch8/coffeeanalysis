## General Visualization

Plots were created to visualize differences between key variables by species.

## Coffee Aesthetic Distribution

The following plot shows how different aesthetic coffee rankings are distributed by species.

## Correlation Matrix

Here is a correlation matrix of the coffee aesthetic variables.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

The following plot shows the result of performing PCA on the data.

## Clustering

Here, I show the results of clustering the data into 2 and 3 clusters.

![3 Clusters](figures/tsne_clusters_3.png)

## Logistic Regression and ROC Curve

I built a logistic regression model to predict robusta or arabica species. The ROC curve is shown below.

The model's AUC is reported as:

```{r, child="data/auc.Rmd"}
