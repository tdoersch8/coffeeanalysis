I am using a coffee quality dataset that includes quality measures
(aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, uniformity, 
cup cleanliness, sweetness, moisture, defects) for different coffee 
beans from the Coffee Quality Institute's trained reviewers. 
It also includes data about the coffee beans (processing method, 
color, species) and farms that produce them (owner, country of origin,
name, lot number, mill, company, altitude, region) 
(https://www.kaggle.com, https://github.com). Subsequently, I plan to analyze
this data using Rstudio to determine whether altitude, country of origin, and 
processing method affect overall coffee bean quality and compare key differences
between coffee bean species.
